- set horizontal and depth as zero ✅
- loop through the array of objects ✅
- if statement that says if command is strictly equal to 'up' then decrease the depth by x units ✅
- else if statment that says if command is strictly equal to 'down' then increase depth by x units ✅
- else if statement that says if command is strictly equal to 'forward' then increase horizontal by x units ✅
- print depth * horizontal ✅

## Part 2 

- create an aim variable starting at 0 ✅
- when command strictly equals up / down account for aim decreasing / increasing ✅
- when command strictly equals forward account for depth increasing by aim multiplied by x units ✅
- print depth * horizontal ✅
